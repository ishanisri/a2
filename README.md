In this, data of a supermarket chain , which had been collected for a month, has been taken from the internet.
Then, using Python, data has been analysed graphically by plotting total sales vs item type, no of items(frequency) vs item type and mrp range vs no of items 
for tier1, tier2 ,tier3 cities' grocery stores and supermarket type1, type2, type 3.
This helps analyse the product type sold the most in a particular region,the product type that brings the highest revenue from a particular region and the MRP range in which items are sold the most in a particular region's store.
